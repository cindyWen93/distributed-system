//Lab1
We met for three evening along with several online discussions, sharing our thoughts.
During the meeting, we analyzed the requirements of the graph server and choose proper data structure.
In order to learn technical knowledge of both http communication and graph manipulation,
we cooperate and divide the workload as follows.

1. HTTP Communication:
  We implemented a simple http communication between server & 'client' together, since this is new to both of us.
2. Graph Manipulation:
  Yanbijia Jin: Data Structure, add_node(), add_edge(), get_neighbors(), get_shortest_path()
  Songzi Wen: Data Structure, remove_node(), remove_edge(), get_node(), get_edge(), get_shortest_path()
3. Returning JSON field:
  Yanbijia Jin: add_node(), add_edge(),get_neighbors(),get_shortest_path()
  Songzi Wen: remove_node(),remove_edge(),get_node(),get_edge,get_shortest_path();
4. Debugging & Comments:
  Since we met for coding and debugging, we did this part all together.
  Having partner while debugging is extremely enjoyable for higher efficiency.
